<p>As a capstone for my course on robotic manipulation, I created a package to direct a Kuka YouBot to pick up and move a block in CoppeliaSim.</p>

### Trajectory Generation

I divided the desired trajectory into 8 segments. First, I needed to have the starting and ending position of the cube in the world frame. I also defined a standoff position that was slightly above the cube which has the grippers at a 45 degree angle to the ground. Each trajectory segment was computed using the

1. <p> Move from the start position to the standoff position above the cube start location </p> 
2. <p> Move straight down in the z direction in preparation to grasp the cube </p> 
3. <p> Grasp the cube </p> 
4. <p> Move straight up, returning to the standoff position </p> 
5. <p> Move to the standoff position corresponding to the cube's final location </p>
6. <p> Move straight down in the z direction in preparation to release the cube </p> 
7. <p> Release the cube </p> 
8. <p> Move straight up, returning to the final standoff position </p>

### Motion and Feedback Control
Once the desired trajectory was generated, I created another function to follow the trajectory using PI control. I compare the actual end effector position to the desired end effector position, and calculate a commanded end effector twist that is a function of the PI controller constants. This controls the wheels of the robot as well as the joints of the arm.

The best behavior (shown below) used a proportional gain of 2 and an integral gain of 0.5.

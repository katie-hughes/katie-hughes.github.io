For my capstone project for my MS in Robotics degree at Northwestern University, I am implementing the Bayes Rule Nash Equilibrium ("BRNE") algorithm onto a Unitree Go1 robot for efficient crowd navigation. This post is not complete as I am still actively working on this project!

# Algorithm

![Description](/assets/images/projects/crowdnav/BRNE-visualization.png)
<center><h6>In this example, two agents are in a hallway. The blue agent wants to walk to the right and the orange agent wants to walk to the left, and their nominal desired paths if no other agents were present are described by the dotted line. The first step is generating samples for each of the agents, as shown in the left panel. After this, the BRNE algorithm uses these randomly generated samples for Bayesian updates to generate optimal trajectories. </h6></center>

# Perception

For localization and pedestrian tracking, I am using a ZED 2i camera from StereoLabs. This camera is mounted on the back of the Unitree and provides updates for both of these topics at 15 Hz.

# System Design

At its core, the BRNE algorithm requires pedestrian location data and odometry data. Then, when given a goal position, it can create a trajectory plan that avoids pedestrians. I am using the `unitree_nav` package 
(<a href="https://github.com/ngmor/unitree_nav" target="_blank"><u>available here</u></a>) to process the `cmd_vel` messages that are the result of the BRNE trajectory plan into high level Unitree commands used by their SDK to control the robot.

I currently, I am using a System76 Adder WS that is mounted onto the back of the Unitree to handle perception data from the ZED (odometry and pedestrian tracking) as well as the actual BRNE algorithm. This is because none of the boards inside of the Unitree (Jetson Nano, Jetson Xavier, and Raspberry Pi) are capable at performing these tasks at the necessary speed. While this performs all of the relevant computation onboard, there are some downsides to this approach. First, it was difficult to design a mount that securely held the laptop on the back of the robot. The robot also has trouble with agile movements and is more prone to falling over from imbalance. With all of the extra weight, the motors also overheat faster, and devices onboard the robot tend to fail sooner (namely the Raspberry Pi provided WIFI hotspot).

My plan going forward is to replace the onboard laptop with an externally mounted Orin Nano board. This will be able to provide the perception based updates at an appropriately fast rate (15 Hz) and will dramatically reduce the load on the robot. The core BRNE algorithm will execute on my external computer as the Orin Nano does not have good enough CPU for the trajectory optimization calculations. (In the future, it might be possible to use CUDA to optimize the performance of the algorithm to this device, and once again have everything onboard).

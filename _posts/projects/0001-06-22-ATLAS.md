<p>From June 2021 to July 2022, I worked as a technician for the ATLAS experiment at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland.</p> 

<br>

<p>My main role was as an expert for the Charge Injection System for the ATLAS Tile Calorimeter. The Tile Calorimeter (TileCal) is a subsystem of the ATLAS detector that functions to measure the energy of the particles created in LHC collisions. This is important in order to reconstruct which kinds of particles were generated in these collisions. The Charge Injection System (CIS) is one of three levels of calibration that this complex system undergoes in order to ensure that this energy reconstruction is accurate. CIS calibration sends a pulse of a known charge to the readout electronics (in pC) and measures the response (in ADC counts). CIS calibration runs occur a few times per week. Even if the detector is not on, monitoring the status of each module's CIS constants over time can help determine the health of the detector and indicate if electronics need maintenance.</p>

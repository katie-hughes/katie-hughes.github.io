<p>For my final project for CE346: Microprocessor System Design, my group and I decided to make a mechanical gripper powered by muscle signals.</p> 

<br>

<p>Our device was built around the Micro:BIT board which is powered by an NRF52833 microcontroller. It takes two analog inputs: an EMG signal from the user's arm, which determines whether the person was flexing, and a force sensitive resistor on the tip of the gripper, which signals when the grippers were holding an object. It controlls one servo motor through I2C. When the user flexes and the signal from the EMG goes high, a signal is sent to the servo to close the grippers. If the FSR ever went high during this action, this overpowers the EMG signal and tells the grippers to stop closing. Finally, if there is no EMG signal, the grippers will open. When put all together, this creates a smooth opening and closing motion that mimics the user's hand. </p>

<p>Additionally, we collaborated with another team of students in the MSR program to merge our final projects. This group created a 2DOF arm that is powered by an IMU. The IMU is worn on the wrist, and when the user tilts their arm, the mechanical arm will mimic the motion. We attached our gripper as an end effector to their arm. Then, the user can wear both the IMU band and the muscle sensor on the same arm for even more control, even being able to complete simple pick-and-place tasks with the arm. </p>

<p>This spring, I had the privilege to perform some outreach at three local events: a <i>Robot Block Party</i> at Chicagoâ€™s Museum of Science and Industry, a <i>Career Day for Girls</i> in the Chicago area, and a <i>Biotech Nexus</i> event, attended by high-schoolers from Lindblom Math and Science Academy."</p> 

<br>

<p>I was able to demonstrate three projects at these events: <a href="https://javtges.github.io/pancakerobot/" target="_blank"><u>Robotic Pancake Chef</u></a>, <a href="https://javtges.github.io/textureclassification/" target="_blank"><u>Tactile Texture Classification</u></a>, and <a href="https://javtges.github.io/gesturerecognition/" target="_blank"><u>Deep Learning for Gesture Recognition</u></a>. Check out Northwestern MSR's 'Inside Our Program' <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/robotics/inside-our-program/stories/2022/bringing-robotics-to-the-public.html" target="_blank"><u>article</u></a> with more information, written by <a href="https://www.zarefsky.com/" target="_blank"><u>Marc Zarefsky</u></a>.

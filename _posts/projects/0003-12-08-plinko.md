<p>For my final project for ME314: Machine Dynamics, I simulated the game plinko from scratch. A plinko chip (represented as a square) falls under gravity through a series of plinko pegs (also represented by squares). The chip experiences elastic collisions with the pegs as it falls, and is subject to friction as it moves across the board.</p>

<p>To simulate this system, I kept track of 3 state variables representing the position and orientation of the plinko chip: x, y, and theta. I then generated and solved the Euler Lagrange equations using SymPy to get descriptions of the motion. What made this problem complicated was keeping track of all of the collisions that could occur during simulation, and calculating the respective impact update equations. As a baseline, I had 16 impact conditions that corresponded to each corner of the chip hitting the 4 bounding walls of the plinko board. For each peg that I added to the system, I needed to add 32 impact conditions and 32 corresponding impact update equations. These correspond to each of the 4 corners of the peg colliding with each of the 4 sides of the chip (16), plus each of the 4 corners of the chip colliding with each of the 4 sides of the peg (another 16). After testing my math extensively with only one peg, I abstracted peg creation into a loop so I could add as many as I liked. My final simulation contained 5 rows of pegs, which corresponds to 496 possible impacts!</p>

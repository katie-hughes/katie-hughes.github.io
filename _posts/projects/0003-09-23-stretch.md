<p>
From June - September 2023, I worked as a software robotics intern for Stretch, Boston Dynamics' warehouse robot. 
</p>



<p>
I also had the opportunity to visit customer sites at 
<a href="https://www.nfiindustries.com/about-nfi/news/nfi-deploys-boston-dynamics-stretch-robot-in-10-million-deal/" target="_blank"><u>NFI</u></a> and 
<a href="https://innovation.maersk.com/innovations/stretch-robot" target="_blank"><u>Maersk</u></a> in Savannah, Georgia.
There, I was able to get feedback from field operators about pain points when using the robot. Having this perspective was very valuable throughout the rest of my summer.

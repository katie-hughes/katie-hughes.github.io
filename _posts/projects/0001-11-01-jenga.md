<p>For my final project for ME495: Embedded Systems in Robotics, my group and I created a ROS2 package to turn an Franka Emika Panda 7DOF arm into a Jenga assistant.</p>

<p>Our core goal was to have the robot play alongside a human. The user would select a block and partially remove it from the tower. The robot would then detect this block, remove it the rest of the way, and place it on the top of the tower.</p>
<br>

<p>My main role on this project centered around computer vision -- given a camera image, how do we detect where the Jenga tower and the partially removed pieces are? This goal was made easier by using a camera that has a depth frame (an Intel Realsense D435i) and choosing a clever camera placement of directly above the center of the tower, looking down. 
From this viewpoint, you will see roughly three groups of objects that exist at distinct distances from the camera. The first is the top of the tower, which is closest to the camera, has a fairly large area, and should be square-shaped at the beginning of the game. The second is the table, which is farthest from the camera and also has a very large contour area. The third is any pieces that might be partially sticking out from the side of the tower. These pieces will always exist at a distance that is somewhere between the top of the tower and the table.
Upon startup, the CV node performs a scan through the depth frame to locate the top of the tower and the table. Then, it repeatedly scans between these two locations to search for pieces to pull. When one is found, the CV node broadcasts the location of its centroid with respect to the camera, so that the movement node can start planning to grab the piece. </p>

The vision node also computes the orientation of the top of the tower on its initial scan. This is necessary so that the pulled pieces can be placed in the correct orientation. When it locates the top of the tower in the depth frame, it applies Canny edge detection and Hough lines on the corresponding portion of the RGB image to determine the angle of the pieces.

I also briefly worked with the movement nodes. A given "turn" is defined by the starting location of the block, and the ending location of placement on top of the tower. The starting location is computed during the CV scans, and the ending locations are precomputed based on the initial height/orientation of the tower and the width of the pieces (so as to ensure that the 3 pieces placed per layer are adjacent). We followed a motion plan that first orients to the piece, then moves in a cartesian path to grab the piece and pull slowly straight backwards. Then, we raise the piece up, orient it to the correct ending placement, place it slightly off the top of the tower, and push it in (see below).
